# LDMUD compilation settings for psycMUVE, the LPC server and client
# implementation of the protocol for synchronous conferencing.
#
# Documents and download on:	http://muve.pages.de
# Information about PSYC:	http://psyc.pages.de
#
# the PSYC implementation and library is designed in a way that it should
# easily co-host in a running LPMUD, it just needs a few patches to the
# master object and #includes in simul_efun.
#
# how to multiplex InterMUD and PSYC on the same udp port:
# PSYC UDP packets always start with ".\n", just forward them to
# the PSYC UDP server daemon.
#
# configure will strip this part from the script.

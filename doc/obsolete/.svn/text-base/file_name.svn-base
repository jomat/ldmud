REMOVED EFUN
SYNOPSIS
        string file_name()
        string file_name(object ob)

DESCRIPTION
        Get the name of an object <ob> or, if no argument is given, of
        the current object.

        This name is the name under which the object is stored in the
        muds object table. It is initialised at the creation of the
        object such that blueprints are named after the file they are
        compiled from (without the trailing '.c'), and clones receive
        the name of their blueprint, extended by '#' followed by
        a unique non-negative number. These rules also apply to
        virtual objects - the real name/type of virtual objects
        is ignored.

        The name of an object can be changed with rename_object(), and
        object_name() will reflect any of these changes.

        The returned name always begins with '/' (absolute path),
        except when the parser runs in COMPAT mode.

EXAMPLES
                find_object(file_name(ob)) == ob

        This is guaranteed to be true for all objects ob that are not
        destructed.

HISTORY
        In LDMud 3.2.6 renamed to object_name(), this old name is
        available as alias.
        Since LDMud 3.2.9, not available if driver is compiled without
          USE_DEPRECATED.
        Removed in LDMud 3.3 .

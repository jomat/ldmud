REMOVED EFUN
SYNOPSIS
        int send_imp(string host, int port, string message)
        int send_imp(string host, int port, int * message)

DESCRIPTION
        Sends The message in an UDP packet to the given host and port
        number.

        The message can be given either as string, or as array of
        bytes. The latter variant allows to send binary data as well.

    The efun causes a privilege violation. If USE_DEPRECATED is in effect,
        it first tries privilege violation ("send_imp"), and, if this one
        returns 0, then it tries privilege violation ("send_udp").
        If USE_DEPRECATED is not in effect, it just tries privilege
        violation ("send_udp").

        Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

        Note: On some machines a failed send_imp() will not be registered
        until the next send_imp() - the latter one might return '0' even
        if itself was successful.

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.2.9 renamed this efun to send_udp(), and also changed the
          privilege violation string and the apply names. This old version
          is available if the driver is compiled with USE_DEPRECATED.
        Removed in LDMud 3.3.

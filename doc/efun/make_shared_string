DEPRECATED
SYNOPSIS
        string make_shared_string(string str)

DESCRIPTION
        Puts <str> in the table of shared strings of the game.

        If the string is used by several variables/objects this
        saves memory. Keys of alists and mappings are always shared
        strings.

        In LDMud 3.3, this function is no longer necessary: strings
        are shared as much as possible anyway, and the driver automatically
        converts untabled strings into tabled strings after some time.

HISTORY
        Introduced in LDMud 3.2.6; following a suggestion from Tubmud.
        Deprecated in LDMud 3.3.531.

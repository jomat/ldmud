SYNOPSIS
        void set_max_commands(int num)
        void set_max_commands(int num, object obj)

DESCRIPTION
        Set the max number of commands the interactive <obj> is
        allowed to execute per second to <num>. A negative value means
        'unlimited' and is the setting for newly created connections.

        If <obj> is not given, the current interactive is queried.

        The function raises a privilege_violation ("set_max_commands",
        obj, num).  If the privilege is denied, the call is ignored.

        A 'command' in this context means every received data packet
        which causes a LPC call - actions and calls to input_to()
        alike.


EXAMPLES
        To establish a mud-wide default for the maximum command rate,
        write master::connect() like this:

        object connect() {
            object obj;

            ...
            set_max_commands(100);
            return obj;
        }

        Upon return from the the function, the connection with its
        modified max_commands will be rebound from the master object
        to the returned object.

HISTORY
        Introduced in LDMud 3.2.10.

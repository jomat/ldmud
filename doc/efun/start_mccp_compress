SYNOPSIS
        #include <telnet.h>

        int start_mccp_compress(int telopt)

DESCRIPTION
        This efun must be called inside an interactive player and starts
        the compression of the driver -> client traffic.

        Return non-zero on success, and 0 on failure.

        <telopt> denotes the MCCP version and must be either TELOPT_COMPRESS2
        or TELOPT_COMRESS from <telnet.h>.

        The only exception is when the telnet machine is disabled: then
        any value will do. This can be used with dedicated clients
        which send text uncompressed but expect to receive it compressed
        (Java clients using InflaterInputStream for example).

        Available only if the driver is compiled with MCCP enabled;
        __MCCP__ is defined in that case.


HISTORY
        Added in LDMud 3.3.447, backported to LDMud 3.2.10.
        LDMud 3.3.666 added the possibility to enable outgoing compression
        when the telnet machine is enabled (not backported).

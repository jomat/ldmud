SYNOPSIS
        void move_object(mixed item, mixed dest)

DESCRIPTION
        The item, which can be an object_name or an object, is moved into
        it's new environment dest, which can also be an object_name or an
        object.

        Since 3.2.1, the innards of move_object() are implemented in
        the mudlib, using the M_MOVE_OBJECT0/1 driver hooks, and move_object()
        might as well be an simul-efun.

        The traditional implementation restricted for !compat mode
        the <item> to the calling object only.

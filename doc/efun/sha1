OBSOLETE
SYNOPSIS
        string sha1(string arg [, int iterations ])
        string sha1(int  * arg [, int iterations ])

DESCRIPTION
        Create and return a SHA1 message digest from <arg>.
        <arg> may be a string, or an array of numbers (each considered to
        be a character, ignoring all but the lowest byte).

        If <iterations> is given as a number greater than 0, it is
        the number of iterations used in the digest calculation. If omitted,
        the driver executes just one iteration.

        The efun costs 5 ticks per iteration.

EXAMPLES
        string s;

        s = sha1("Hello");
        s = sha1( ({ 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' })

HISTORY
        Introduced in LDMud 3.3.523.
        LDMud 3.3.712 added number arrays as argument, and the number
          of iterations.
        LDMud 3.3.717 added the iteration-based evaluation cost.
        Since LDMud 3.3.719 obsoleted by hash().

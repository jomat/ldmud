SYNOPSIS
        void shutdown()
        void shutdown(int exit_code)

DESCRIPTION
        Shutdown the mud, setting the process result code to
        <exit_code>, or 0 if not given.

        Never use this efun. Instead if you have a need to shutdown
        the mud use the shutdown command.  You may be asking yourself,
        if you're not supposed to use it why is it here?  Sorry, I
        cannot answer that.  Its top secret.

        The efun causes a privilege violation.

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.2.11 introduced the exit code.
        LDMud 3.5.0 made the efun privileged.

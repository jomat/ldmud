SYNOPSIS
        string set_bit(string str, int n)

DESCRIPTION
        Return the new string where bit n is set in string str. Note
        that the old string str is not modified.

        Each character contains 6 bits. So you can store a value
        between 0 and 63 in one character (2^6=64). Starting character
        is the blank " " which has the value 0. The first charcter in
        the string is the one with the lowest bits (0-5).

        The new string will automatically be extended if needed.

EXAMPLES
        string s;
        s=set_bit("?",5);

        Because "?" has a value of 31 the variable s will now contain
        the character "_" which is equal to 63 (31+2^5=63).

        string s;
        s=set_bit("78",3);
        s=set_bit(s,8);

        s will now contain the string "?<".

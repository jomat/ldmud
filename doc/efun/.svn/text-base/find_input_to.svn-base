SYNOPSIS
        int find_input_to(object player, string fun)
        int find_input_to(object player, closure fun)
        int find_input_to(object player, object fun)
        int find_input_to(object player, object ob, string fun)

DESCRIPTION
        Find the input_to most recently added to the interactive <player>
        object matching the <fun> argument:
         - <fun> is a string: the input_to functionname has to match
         - <fun> is an object: the object the input_to function is bound to
                               has to match
         - <fun> is a closure: the input_to closure has to match.
         - <ob> and <fun> are given: both the object and the functionname have
                               to match

        Return -1 if not found, or the position in the input_to stack (0
        being _least_ recently added input_to).

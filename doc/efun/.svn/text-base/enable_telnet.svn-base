SYNOPSIS
        int enable_telnet(int num)
        int enable_telnet(int num, object obj)

DESCRIPTION
        Enable or disable the telnet machine for the interactive object <obj>.
        Return the previous state of the telnet machine as result.
        
        <num> > 0 : enable telnet machine (default)
              = 0 : disable telnet machine
              < 0 : just query the current state of the telnet machine.
        <obj> : the interactive object, default is the current interactive.
                For non-interactive objects the function raises an error.
        
        The function raises a privilege_violation ("enable_telnet", obj, num)
        if <num> is >= 0. If the privilege is denied, the call is ignored.
        
        WARNING: Careless use of this efun can cause great confusion for both
        driver and clients! The efun exists mainly to support PSYCmuve, and
        may vanish if a more consistent way of handling network connections
        is introduced.

HISTORY
        Introduced in LDMud 3.2.10.

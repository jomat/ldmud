SYNOPSIS
        void set_connection_charset(int *bitvector, int quote_iac)
        void set_connection_charset(string charset, int quote_iac)
        void set_connection_charset(0, int quote_iac)

DESCRIPTION
        Set the set of characters that can be output to the
        interactive user (this does not apply to binary_message()).
        The function must be called by the interactive user object
        itself.

        The charset can be given either directly as a string, or
        indirectly as a bitvector. If the charset is given as the
        number 0, the default connection charset is re-established.

        The bitvector is interpreted as an array of 8-bit-values and
        might contain up to 32 elements. Character n is allowed to be
        output if sizeof(bitvector) > n/8 && bitvector[n/8] & (1 << n%8) .

        If quote_iac is 0 and char 255 is allowed to be output, IAC
        will be output unmodified.
        If quote_iac is 1 and char 255 is allowed to be output, char
        255 will be quoted so that it is not interpreted as IAC by the
        telnet protocol. This is the default.

HISTORY
        Introduced in 3.2.1@40.
        LDMud 3.2.8 added the ability to specify the charset as a string.
        LDMud 3.2.10 added the ability to reset the charset to the default.

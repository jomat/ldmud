SYNOPSIS
        int write_file(string file, string str)
        int write_file(string file, string str, int flags)

DESCRIPTION
        Append the string <str> to the file <file>. Returns 1 for success
        and 0 if any failure occured.

        If <flags> is 1, the file is removed first; thus making the
        'append' effectively an 'overwrite'. Default for <flags> is 0.

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.3.523 added the <flags> parameter.

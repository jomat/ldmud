SYNOPSIS
        string ctime(int clock)
        string ctime(int *uclock)

DESCRIPTION
        Interpret the argument clock as number of seconds since Jan,
        1st, 1970, 0.00 and convert it to a nice date and time string.
        If clock is not specified, time() is used as default.

        The second form is like the first, except that it takes as argument
        an array of ints as it is returned from utime(): int[0] is the number
        of seconds like before, int[1] is the number of microseconds within
        that second.

EXAMPLES
        write(ctime()+"\n");

        This will print out something like "Fri Jul 17 19:13:33 1992".

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.2.9 introduced the second form.

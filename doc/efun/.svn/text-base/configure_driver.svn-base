SYNOPSIS
        #include <configuration.h>

        void configure_driver(int what, mixed data)

DESCRIPTION
        Sets the option <what> to the value <data>.

        This function always causes the privilege_violation
        ("configure_driver", this_object(), what, data).

        <what> == DC_MEMORY_LIMIT
           Set new soft and hard memory limits for the driver.
           <data> is expected to be an array with two elements, which have to
           be integers giving the amount of memory in bytes.
           ({<soft memory limit>, <hard memory limit>})
        <what> == DC_ENABLE_HEART_BEATS
           Globally enable the calling of Heartbeats, if <data> is 1,
           globally disable them if <data> is 0.
           If called during heartbeat processing, the change comes into effect
           at the next backend cycle.
        <what> == DC_LONG_EXEC_TIME
           Set the time considered as (too) long for top-level executions. If
           an execution exceeds this time, a stack trace will be written to
           the debug log. The execution will continue at that point.
           <data> is an integer and measured in microseconds.
           A time of 0 disables the detection of long executions.

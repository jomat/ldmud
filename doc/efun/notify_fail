SYNOPSIS
        int notify_fail(string str)
        int notify_fail(closure cl)

DESCRIPTION
        Store str as the error message given instead of the default
        message ``What ?''. The result is always 0.

        If a closure is given, it is executed to return the error
        message string, but not before all attempts to execute the
        commandline failed (read: not at the time of the call to
        notify_fail()). The closure receives as argument the original
        commandgiver; usually it is identical to this_player(), unless
        the modify_cmd hook changed that.

        If notify_fail() is called more than once for this command, only the
        last call will be used. However, calls to notify_fail() in nested
        commands have no effect on this command.

        The idea of this function is to give better error messages
        instead of simply 'What ?'.

        It is also better to use
                return notify_fail(message);
        instead of
                write(message); return 1;

        Other objects will get the chance to evaluate the verb.

HISTORY
        Returntype changed in LDMud 3.2.6 from void to int.
        Since LDMud 3.2.7, notify-fail settings are saved over nested
        commands, and NPCs can see their notify-fail messages.

SYNOPSIS
        mixed * m_entry(mapping map, mixed key)

DESCRIPTION
        Query the mapping <map> for the entry for <key> and return all
        its values in one array.

        at once.

EXAMPLES
        mapping m = ([ 1:"foo":-1, 2:"bar":-2 ]);

        m_entry(m, 0) -> 0
        m_entry(m, 1) -> ({ "foo", -1 })

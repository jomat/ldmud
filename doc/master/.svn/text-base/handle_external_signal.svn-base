SYNOPSIS
        #include <signals.h>

        int handle_external_signal(int signal)

DESCRIPTION
       If the driver receives a signal from the OS it forwards it to the
       mudlib master by calling this function. The signal received by the
       driver is given in <signal> and may be one of the following:
       SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2.

       If this function returns != 0, the driver will assume the signal has
       been dealt with and take NO further action.
       The exception is SIGTERM, which can't be handled. The driver will
       perform a graceful shutdown of the game after this function returns.

       If the master does not handle the signal (returns 0 or this function
       doe not exit), the driver will perform the following default actions:

       SIGHUP:  begin a graceful shutdown
       SIGINT:  send itself an unhandled SIGINT. This usually causes an
                immediate and non-graceful shutdown.
       SIGUSR1: the driver will reload the master object
       SIGUSR2: the driver will re-open its debug log file

This is 'LDMud', a gamedriver for LPMuds.
(LPC compiler, interpreter and runtime environment.)

LDMud started as a project to clean up and modernize Amylaar's LPMud
gamedriver. Primary goals are full documentation, a commented source body and
out-of-the-box support for the major mudlibs, of which the commented source
body has been pretty much completed. During the course of work a lot of bug
fixes and improvements found their way into the driver - much more than
originally expected, and definitely enough to make LDMud a driver in its own
right.

The latest stable version is available on our homepage at
